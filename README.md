Customer Retention & Churn Analysis Dashboard:

1.Project Overview:

This project analyzes customer churn patterns using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
The objective is to identify churn drivers, customer lifetime trends, and actionable retention strategies — similar to real-world SaaS analytics use cases.

2.Business Questions Answered:

 Why are customers leaving the platform?
 Which customer segments are most likely to churn?
 How long do customers typically stay active?
 What actions can improve customer retention?

3. Tools Used
   
  Power BI Desktop
  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
  Data Cleaning & Transformation
  Cohort Segmentation
  Customer Lifetime Value Estimation

4. Dashboard Sections
   
1️⃣ Executive Summary

   Total Customers
   Churn Rate
   Average Tenure
   Estimated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

2️⃣ Churn Segmentation

   Churn by Contract Type
   Churn by Payment Method
   Churn by Internet Service
   Churn by Tenure Group (Cohort-style segmentation)

3️⃣ Customer Lifetime Analysis

   Tenure Distribution
   Estimated CLV
   High-risk early-stage customers

5. Key Insights
   
1️⃣ Contract Type Is the Strongest Churn Driver

Month-to-month customers show the highest churn rate compared to one-year and two-year contract customers.

2️⃣ Early Tenure Customers Are High Risk

Majority of churn occurs within the first 12 months.

3️⃣ Payment Behavior Matters

Electronic check users have higher churn probability.

4️⃣ Long-Term Customers Generate Higher Lifetime Value

Customers staying beyond 2 years contribute significantly to revenue stability.

6. Estimated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
   
CLV was estimated using:
CLV = Average Monthly Charges × Average Tenure
This provides an approximate measure of long-term customer revenue contribution.

8. Recommendations
   
Incentivize long-term contracts
Improve onboarding during first 6 months
Encourage automated payment methods
Introduce loyalty benefits after 1 year

9. Conclusion
    
Customer churn is heavily influenced by contract commitment and early-stage customer experience.
Reducing churn among first-year customers and encouraging long-term contracts can significantly improve retention and revenue stability.
